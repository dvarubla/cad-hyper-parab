## What does this script do?
This script draws 

1. hyperbola by apex and two points on one half of the branch (`hyper` command)
2. rectangular hyperbola by apex, one point on a branch and one point inside hyperbola (`rhyper` command)
3. parabola by apex, one point on a parabola and one point inside parabola (`parab` command) 

in AutoCAD (tested in AutoCAD 2014) and BricsCAD (tested in BricsCAD 16)

All curves are drawn using splines. 

Simply type `APPLOAD` and select this .lsp file. 

I think that there are some other hyperbola.lsp and parabola.lsp files on the internet but haven't found them. So I decided to write my own.
